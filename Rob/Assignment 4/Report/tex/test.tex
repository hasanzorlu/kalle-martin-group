\section{Testing the System}
\label{sec:test}

Testing the system was done by uploading the path file (with joint information) to the robot to see if the movement correspond to our intention. Before the physical test is performed we simulate the path movement with RobWorkStudio, and determine if is robot remains within the bounds of its cage.\\

The simulation with RobWorkStudio appeared to move correctly, and the robot arm remained inside the cage.
