The robot was properly simulated with RobWorkStudio. A C\# application tool was developed to create points from text. A plugin was develop for RobWorkStudio that create the path from the given points and convertes the path to a format the Fanuc robot can understand. We gained practical experiance of working with a robot, and developing with RobWorkStudio. Further improvents to our path planner and Letter Font application were not implemented due to time constraints, but the improvement were discussed in this report.
