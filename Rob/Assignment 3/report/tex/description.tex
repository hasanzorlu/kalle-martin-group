The task was to simulate a Denso VS-6556 robot, and simulate it in Robwork. We had a data specification sheet of the Denso robot, .obj 3D model, and .mtl file which is a description of the material of the .obj model. The task was to find DH-parameters, and create a RobWork XML file, load it,
and simulate in RobWork. The .obj model can't be loaded as it is but it needs to be split up into links with joints and saved as .ac format before RobWork can load the new models. Then to make use of collision detection between links new collision 3D models needs to be created.
