The task was to create a device file enabling simulation of a Denso VS-6556 robot in Robwork. We had a data specification sheet of the Denso robot, .obj 3D model, and .mtl file which is a description of the material of the .obj model. The task was to find DH-parameters and create a RobWork XML file, load it, and simulate it in RobWork. The .obj model can't be loaded as it is but needs to be split up into separate components representing the links between the joints and saved in the .ac format(AC3D) before RobWork can load the new models. Then to make use of collision detection between links, new 3D collision models had to be created and added to the device file.
