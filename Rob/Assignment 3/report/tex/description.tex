The task was to build a Denso VS-5656 device, and simulate it in Robwork. We had a description of DH parameters, .obj file where was the 
device, and .mtl file which is a description of .obj file. According DH parameters need to place frames, and create a XML file, load it,
and simulate in RobWork. The collision model should be consider and build as well.
