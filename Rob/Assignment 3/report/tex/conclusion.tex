The Denso VS-6556 was imported successfully into RobWorkStudio using the specification and the model. The model was split up properly and the model was tested with various angles to see if the joints, parameters, graphics and collision functioned correctly, which they all did. Depending on the correlation between links and corresponding collision models, collisions sometimes occurred preemptively. The simple collision models could easily be improved to better represent the actual links, thereby reducing faulty collisions, as every collision model save one uses a single box encompassing the link to detect collisions. This was deemed sufficient for the assignment based on the existing model samples and their collision models or lack thereof.
