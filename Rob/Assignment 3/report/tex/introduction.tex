\section{Introduction}

In this assignment the robot Denso VS-6556 has been analyzed, DH parameters has been found from a datasheet of the Denso and a RobWork XML device file has been constructed, making it possible to simulate a Denso robot in RobWorkStudio. The specification and a 3D model of the robot was provided beforehand. The 3D model was split into several components, dividing it into base, joints and end-effector, all of which were included in the simple RobWork skeleton device file created from the DH parameters.
