\section{Conclusion}
Robwork was fairly easy to program to when one got used to the unfamiliar QT framework and presented no problems for the group except for the very common problems encountered during installation and compilation of Robworks.\\
The implementation of the plugin consists of several steps. The first task was to figure out the mathematical equations for finding the angles $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$. The angles were found by taking the Euler matrix and applying some trigonometric formulas. Second step was to implement the plugin by applying the beforementioned mathematics including the special cases. Finally, six Euler and their similar six Fixed cases were implemented. The new plugin was tested, though not conclusively, but seems to successfully implement the required functionality.
