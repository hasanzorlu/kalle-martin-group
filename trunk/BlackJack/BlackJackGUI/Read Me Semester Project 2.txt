Description: A simple BlackJack application, with the computer being the dealer and the user being the player. The game consist 
of only one deck.The game has a betting system that allow the play to place bets on each hand. 
The bet is reset at the end of each hand.

The code is commented, and is easy to read and understand. The project also includes a class diagram (a .cd file) created
 with visual studio 2008.

The basic rules of the game involve adding the value of an initial two card hand in hopes of being dealt a value of twenty-one. 
If a value of less than twenty-one is dealt, the player may choose to be dealt single cards until they either reach a value of 
twenty one, reach a value they feel comfortable to play, or reach a value that exceeds twenty-one. The winner holds a hand with
 a value of, or nearest to, twenty-one without exceeding it.
