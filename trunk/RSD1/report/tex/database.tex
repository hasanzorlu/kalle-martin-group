\section{Database design}

Around the world there are a lot of different types of databases [1]. However we used mySQL most popular â€“ relational database. Relational databases are easily understand [2] and use. In general relational databases - collection of relations and also it fit all our requirements.

\subsection{Why MySQL?}

Amount of different relational databases are huge [3] and sometimes are difficult to choose. Our choice was MySQL database, because it is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Open source database
	\item Ease to use
	\item Fast performance
	\item Reliable 
	\item Most popular open source DB in the world
	\item It is used by Yahoo!, Alcatel-Lucent, Google, Nokia, YouTube and others
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ER diagram}

Design of the database mostly starts from modeling database. One of the most popular approaches is conceptual modeling by using entity relational diagram (ER) [4]. Entity relational diagram shows collections of relations in modeling database. ER diagram allow easily understand concept of the database. Another methodology to model database can be used UML diagram. Most of the OOP programmers are familiar to UML and it make so popular. In our design we used ER diagram and later it were converted to UML [Appendix B].

\subsection{Implementation}

Make database to work we need create tables and move them into database. Database tables were created by using query language like shown in the figure 5.1. All the code was written into text file and text file uploaded directly to database by using created configurator tool.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{Person and Name tables}
	\label{fig:planning}
\end{figure}

Table person have three attributes: CPR, type and pictureURL and primary key for CPR. Primary key makes table to be unique, without a key table become weak entity type, note that always is good to have tables of strong entity types [4]. Foreign key makes table name also unique. In other words table name have one unique reference to table person and table person is unique. \\ Make easy for database management were created database configurator, which is able connect to database and configure by query language or send files with configuration sentences. This manner let faster update and change without writing. 

\subsection{Future work}

Usage of all tables is not optimal and some attributes do not used at all so space usage can be decreased.
Speed increased
