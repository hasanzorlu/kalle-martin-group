\section{Collaboration between subtasks}

The project requires collaboration between subtasks. Each subtask has its own knowledge area, requirements and expectations, however the subtasks are closely related. Our subtask is completely software orientated. The collaboration with the other subtask are described in the following subsections:

\subsection{Collaboration between subtask 4 and 5}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Requirements from task 4
	\subitem - Provide list of scanned clothes using defined protocol [Appendix A]
	\item Requirements to task 4
	\subitem - No requirements.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collaboration between subtask 6 and 5}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Requirements from sub task 6
	\subitem - Provide access to data base through created library.
	\item Requirements to task 6
	\subitem - Provide library of RFID readers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collaboration between subtask 2 and 5}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Requirements from sub task 2

During the project there were many meetings between groups to understand the project flow, complexity, find and solve any problems. Meetings and discussions were important to understand what is wrong and what is going well. The meetings were very productive, helped stay on schedule and accomplish our goals.
