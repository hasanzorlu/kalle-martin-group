\section{Conclusion}

The project goal were to create clothes registering interface and robot arm control by using sorting algorithm. To achieve mentioned goals were closely colaboreted between subtasks 4 and 6. Bellow implemented parts:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We introduced to MySQL Data base system and understanded basic principles. Also were designed ER and UML diagrams. By using MySQL language were created data base and tested.
	\item By using C\# and MySQL .NET connector were created mySQL library which comunicates with MySQL data base. All functionalies of MySQL library were achieved and tested. Regarding this clothe registering interface were created.
	\item By using C\# were created Socet transfer server and also defined comunication protocol. Throw Socket transfer server were controled robot arm.
	\item Main task were to create a sorting algorithm. By using Sorting algoriithm all clothes sorted and information about BinID stored into database. Implemented algorithm sorting by color and washing temperature. later offered and explained more advance sorting algorithm which can be more optimal and flexible.
	\item RFID reader control. By using C\# and .dll libraries were created control logic. Control logic take care of relable clothe read.
