\section{Conclusion}


The project goal were to create clothes registering interface and robot armcontrol by using sorting algorithm. A flexible database and sorting algorithm was created, that collaborates with the other subtasks. The sorting algorithm achieves the set goal, parameters and future improvements have been documented. The goals were achieved by closely collaborating with the groups of subtasks 4 and 6.

Bellow implemented parts:
\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item We introduced and understood basic principles of MySQL Data base system. Also was designed ER and UML diagrams. By using MySQL language was created data base and tested.

	\item By using C\# and MySQL .NET connector tool was created MySQL library which comunicates with MySQL data base. All functionalies of MySQL library were achieved and tested.

	\item By using C\# was created Socket transfer server and also defned comunication protocol. Socket transfer server is used for controling robot arm.

	\item The main task of the project was to create a sorting algorithm. By using Sorting algorithm all clothes are sorted and information about BinID is stored into
database. Implemented algorithm sorts by color and washing temperature's information of clothes. Later on, is offered and explained more advanced sorting algorithm which could be optimal and improve flexibility.

	\item RFID reader control. By using C\# and .dll libraries was created control logic. Control logic takes care of reliable clothes' reading.
