This is turtlekit2 application by F. Michel - G. Beurier! It runs using the MadKit kernel : http://www.madkit.org

It requires a valid installation of java 3d: To make it work, 
please download the library files corresponding to your achitecture at https://java3d.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html
Then, no need to replace the jar files, but you should find library (a dll (windows) or so file (linux) corresponding to your achitecture: put them in the lib directory of TurtleKit.

It should then work.
By default, TurtleKit contains library files for linux amd 64 and windows amd 64

To run a simulation:
- start turtlekit3 (.bat or .sh),
- load a simulation (.xml)
- start and enjoy.
