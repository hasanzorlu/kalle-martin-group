  </div>
</div>
<p>MadKit is a powerful system-independent distributed computing platform. Each 
  MadKit kernel may act as a node of a complex distributed environment. Connections 
  betweens kernels are done by a specific agent called the <span class="emphasis"><i>Communicator</i></span> 
  which handles distributed communications between agents situated in different 
  kernels and synchronization of distributed groupes, i.e. groups that span across 
  multiple kernels. </p>
<p> When multiple kernels are connected, the resulting MadKit network forms a 
  distributed platform for building and running distributed applications using 
  agents as the main components. Agents may be used to connect users, share MadKit 
  applications, services, and documents of any kind. </p>

      <h2 class="title">Communities</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p> It is important to be aware of the concept of <span class="emphasis"><i>Community</i></span>, 
    when one is either designing a MadKit application or simply executing and 
    deploying such an application. A "community" is simply a group of connected 
    MadKit kernels. This concept is used to partition a whole MadKit network in 
    order to: 
  <div class="orderedlist">
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>To speed it up,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To propose a conceptual repartition of resources and services,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To provide a framework for securizing distributed applications.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  When designing an application in MadKit, you may create groups that belong to 
  specific communities {{see the createGroup function}}. A community, from a programmer's 
  point of view may be seen as a space for arranging several groups that are used 
  in the same application. For instance, the Chat application, which implements 
  a simple but realistic Chat in a <span class="emphasis"><i>peer-to-peer</i></span>, 
  is organized along a <tt>chat</tt> community, in which groups represent the 
  topics of the Chat. When a Chat agent creates a "topic" with name <tt>myTopic</tt>, 
  a <tt>myTopic</tt> group is created within the <tt>chat</tt> community. When 
  a kernel M wants to join the Chat application, it simply connects itself to 
  another kernel by specifying its hostname and port number, and its personal 
  Chat agent join the community Chat (See the {{link}} Chat application to get 
  an overwiew of its features and mode of operation).

  <p> The following figure shows a diagram which represents an example of communities 

    
  <p><img src="images/communities.gif" align="center"></p>
    <p><b>Figure 6. Communities with different kernels</b></p>

  with 3 communities (commnity1, community2 and public), 3 kernels (A, B and C) 
  and a set of groups and agents. A kernel is represented by a specific agent, 
  the <tt>SiteAgent</tt>. This agent dialogs with the kernel to synchronize information 
  about groups, roles and agents that belong to communities. One can see the following 
  properties: 
  <div class="itemizedlist">
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>
        <p>A group may appear in only one community. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A kernel (a SiteAgent) may belong to several communities. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The community <tt>public</tt> is global and all kernels belong to this 
          community. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>An agent may belong to several communities. But a kernel sees only 
          an agent from the community to which this kernel belongs. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <p> A MadKit network is both an open and securized network. It is an opened 
    network because any MadKit kernel may join such a network, by connecting to 
    a kernel which is part of it. But it is also a protected network, because 
    communities may be restricted to specific kernels, using the authorization 
    mechanism of groups. </p>

      <h2 class="title">Connecting a kernel to a MadKit network</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Connection of a kernel to a MadKit network is done with the help of the <b>NetAgent</b>. 
    To make a connection, follow these steps: </p>
  <div class="orderedlist">
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>Launch a <tt>Communicator</tt> agent, by clicking on the <b>Agents</b><b>&gt;Communicator</b> 
          for instance. This will open two windows: the window of the <tt>Communicator 
          </tt>itself, and a window corresponding to the <tt>SiteAgent</tt> which 
          lists all communities to which this kernel may belong. A green led indicates 
          that the <tt>Communicator</tt> is working. 
        <p><img src="../../plugins/documentation/docs/agents/systempack/communicator1.gif"></p>
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the texfields of the <tt>Communicator</tt>, type the name of the 
          host computer (and its port number, if it different from the default 
          port 4444) where another kernel is already running. This remote kernel 
          must have its <tt>Communicator</tt> already launched and active. If 
          everything is correct, you will see the name of the host computer inside 
          the list of connected hosts. </p>
        <p>If the remote host is already connected to a set of hosts, you will 
          see the name of all hosts in the list of connected hosts of the <tt>SiteAgent</tt> 
          window. 
        <p><img src="../../plugins/documentation/docs/agents/systempack/communicator3_bis.gif"></p>
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If there are new communities, you may ask your kernel to belong to 
          them by clicking on the <tt>connected</tt> checkbox. 
        <p><img src="../../plugins/documentation/docs/agents/systempack/communicator4.gif"></p>
        <p></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <p>Once you have performed these steps, your kernel is connected directly to 
    all kernels and is now now part of a bigger network. It is said that the configuration 
    of the network is <span class="emphasis"><i>complete</i></span>, because each 
    kernel is connected directly to all other kernels. There is no dedicated &#8220;server&#8221; 
    (and thus no &#8220;clients&#8221;). MadKit networks behave in a &#8220;peer-to-peer&#8221; 
    mode where all kernels are both server and client in the same time. </p>
  <p><span class="bold"><b>Note:</b></span> A complete network is fast and reliable 
    but use a lot of resources for connection and it is not possible to build 
    large networks with this configuration schema. Thus, in the near future, a 
    new <tt>Communicator</tt> will be soon available. It which diminishes the 
    number of connection while preserving most of the speed and reliability of 
    the network. The configuration mode will still be &#8220;peer-to-peer&#8221;. 
  </p>
  <p>The <a href="../../plugins/documentation/docs/agents/systempack/systempack.html#groupobserver" target="_top"><tt>GroupObserver</tt> 
    agent </a>shows all groups and roles belonging to communities to which the 
    local kernel is connected. The community called <tt>Communities</tt> contain 
    the set of communities to which the local kernel belongs. Each community is 
    then seen as a group in the <tt>Communities</tt> community. The <tt>site</tt> 
    role shows all kernels (i.e. all <tt>SiteAgent</tt>) which belongs to a given 
    community.
