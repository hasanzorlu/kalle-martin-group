<h2>Answers</h2>
<h3><a name="General"></a>General</h3>
<h4><a name="DISTRIB"></a>Could I use MadKit to create a distributed application</h4>
<p>Yes, MadKit is an agent oriented middleware with which you may build distributed 
  applications. One of the most interesting feature of MadKit is that distribution 
  is done transparently. You do not have to take care of which agent is remote 
  or not, Madkit, is handling all the necessary communications and connections 
  to make agents situated on different platforms work together transparently. 
  All you have to care is 1) Use the message passing technique of communication 
  between agents, 2) Run MadKit on the two remote kernels (let us call the computers 
  <code>toto.org</code> and <code>riri.net</code>), and open a <code>Communicator</code> 
  agent on both of them. On one of them (<code>toto.org</code> for instance) you 
  type the name of the other one (<code>riri.net</code> then) and the two will 
  be connected. This means that the organization of <code>toto.org</code> will 
  be seen by <code>riri.net</code> (and vice-versa) except for local groups and 
  some communities, and that agents of both platforms may communicate. Test a 
  demo program (for instance <code>ping-pong</code> or <code>travel</code>) with 
  some agents on one kernel and some agents on the other one... See the <a href="userguide/userguide.html">User 
  Guide</a> and the <a href="agents/systempack/systempack.html#IDALEKYG">description 
  of the Communicator agent</a> to get some details about it. You have to be aware 
  that MadKit works on a 'peer to peer' basis, i.e. there is no &quot;server&quot; 
  and &quot;client&quot;. Every kernel is both a server and a client...</p>
<h4><a name="simulation"></a>Could I use MadKit to build agent based simulations?</h4>
<p>Yes MadKit has been widely used for agent based simulations. {{to be detailed}}. 
  See the <a href="devguide/devguide.html#IDA4SHKG">synchronous engine</a> to 
  get information about the basic tools and techniques of agent based simulation 
  (scheduling and observation essentially), and see the Turtle kits manuals (<a href="agents/turtlekit/t1.html">TurtleKit</a> 
  and <a href="agents/turtlepack/t1.html">Turtle packs</a>), a more &quot;high 
  level&quot; development context for building simple reactive agents acting in 
  a two dimension environment. <a href="warbot/index.htm">Warbot</a> is also a 
  simulation context for testing coordination schemes, which is based on the synchronous 
  engine. </p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="installation"></a>Installing and running MadKit for the first time</h2>
<h4><a name="nothing"></a>I have not been able to install MadKit at all. Nothing 
  happens when I try to to use the installer</h4>
<p>Do you have a Java virtual machine installed. MadKit uses a Java 1.3. It uses 
  only the JRE (run time support) for its own purpose, but if you want to develop 
  your agents in Java, you should have a JDK 1.3 (or higher, we use JDK 1.4 for 
  our own purposes) installed...</p>
<h4><a name="install_linux"></a>I had a bug when installing MadKit to Linux, the 
  install did not work</h4>
<p>We have been aware of a very strange bug which may appear on some Linux distribution. 
  We use the InstallAnywhere program for installing MadKit. But this Java based 
  program does not use the command Java, and tries to guess what Java to run. 
  Unfortunately some Linux distribution comes with a very old Java virtual machine 
  (called Kaffe) and InstallAnywhere may use it by mistake. Thus, if the install 
  does not work, check your Java installation. Be sure that you have at least 
  a jdk 1.3 (type<code> java -version</code> to know the version of your JVM) 
  installed and remove all obsolete JVM (and remove Kaffe!).</p>
<h4><a name="hang_python"></a>When I run MadKit and I click on some applications, 
  MadKit hangs...</h4>
<p>MadKit may hangs the first time you use it when you click on a Python agent. 
  The first time Python is used, it creates a <code>cachedir</code> directory 
  in the install directory of MadKit. This may takes between 10 s to 30 s dependings 
  on your computer. But this will happen only once. Afterwards, you will be able 
  to use Python agents quite smoothly and quickly.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="desktop"></a>Desktop</h3>
<h4>How could I build my own toolbar and launch my agents from it?</h4>
<p>This is quite simple. You just have to modify the <code>desktop.ini</code> 
  file. See the User Guide, <a href="userguide/userguide.html#desktopconfig">configuring 
  the Desktop</a>.</p>
<h4>I made a new script file and I don't see it in the MadKit explorator?</h4>
<p>For the moment you have to quit MadKit and start it back. The construction 
  of the whole tree is done at launch time. This is a bug which will be solved 
  very soon. We are really sorry about it...</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="develop"></a>Agents development </h3>
<h4><a name="request"></a>I did a 'requestRole' (or 'createGroup'..) in the constructor 
  of the agent but it sends me error messages...</h4>
<p>You may only use the agent stuff (all the primitives concerning groups and 
  roles) of an agent AFTER its launch time. Thus, the best way to put all these 
  things is in its <code>activate()</code> method not in its constructor. When 
  executing its constructor, and agent is still an object and not an agent yet.</p>
<h4><a name="seconds"></a>When I send a message to another agent, it seems to 
  take a lot of time to be taken into account by the receiver</h4>
<p>This is not normal. Check the connection between the two computers, and use 
  a demo program which uses the connection (for instance you connect the two computers 
  using the communicator, and start a 'PingPong' agent on both computers). </p>
<p>If this test succeeds, then you must suppose that your agent is responsible 
  for it. Maybe you use a <code>while</code> loop in the activate() or live() 
  methods in which your agent is trapped.</p>
<p>If it fails, check the connection between the computers. Make sure that the 
  version of MadKit in the two computers are not too different (version 2.x and 
  versions 3.x are not compatible, but all versions 3.1bx are compatibles). Try 
  some 'pings' between the two computers. Check if they are connected by a network 
  (sometimes a cable is simply missing... ;-) this happens to everybody..).</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="remote"></a>Communications with distant kernels </h3>
<h4><a name="sockets"></a>I would like to make remote agents communicate. Do I 
  have to use Java sockets or RMI?</h4>
<p>No you do not have to. MadKit is taking care of all the low level communications. 
  You only have to concentrate on your application. If your agents may communicate 
  inside the same kernel (the same MadKit application if you prefer), then they 
  may communicate and interact through a network (local network or Internet). 
  Sockets are handled by MadKit. RMI is good for client/server applications, but 
  much too slow to be used a basis for building peer-to-peer applications. See 
  the <a href="#DISTRIB">answer on distributed applications</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="serializable"></a>I could send messages between agents in the same 
  virtual machine, but nothing happens when I connected two distant kernels.</h4>
<p>This may be due to an important point: if your messages have to transport objects, 
  these objects have to be declared as 'serializable'. Just make your objects 
  implements the <code>java.io.serializable</code> interface.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: be aware that serialization of objects is time consuming 
  and that serialization copy ALL the objects that are referenced by this object. 
  Thus you should take care of not transporting &quot;heavy&quot; objects. Objects 
  having only attributes of primitive types (such as numbers or booleans), or 
  strings, or collections of such things are OK. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="GUI"></a>GUI </h3>
<h4><a name="JPanel"></a>I added a GUI to an agent as a JPanel. Could I change 
  it dynamically. Can MadKit agents change their GUI on the fly?</h4>
<p>No you cannot. An agent should get its GUI object permanently. But if your 
  GUI is a JPanel, you may add and remove graphic component to this JPanel dynamically.</p>
<h4>I would like to see the GUI of several agents in the same window. How could 
  I do it?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="develop"></a>Developping agents under MadKit </h3>
<h4><a name="tutorial"></a>I tried to run the tutorial, but I had errors when 
  I put the jars into the autoload directory and I started the Desktop..</h4>
<p>To compile the tutorial, you have two solutions: the first one consists in 
  using the <code>compile.bat</code> (there is no <code>compile.sh</code>, but 
  this should be staightforward to make one from the <code>compile.bat</code> 
  for any Unix user). This file compiles the .java files, build the .class, makes 
  a jar and copy this jar into the autoload directory.</p>
<p>The second one, which is the best one I think, is to use the <strong>Ant</strong> 
  program, which is a kind a 'make' program written in Java. <strong>Ant</strong> 
  is very popular amond Java developper and if you plan to develop all your agents 
  in Java, you should consider Ant. We have placed a build.xml file (the kind 
  of file ant uses) in the all tutorial folders. This file does the same as the 
  compile.bat above, but does in a better way ;-). Open a shell (also called terminal, 
  DOS or command prompt) go to your tutorial directory and type: <code>ant</code>. 
  That's all: the java files are compiled, the jar is made and placed in the autoload 
  folder automatically.</p>
<h4><a name="reload"></a>Do I have to reload MadKit each time I compile my Java 
  agents to use them? </h4>
<p>Unfortunately yes! Well, for the moment, If you want to use the Desktop, you 
  have to reload MadKit each time you develop a recompile a Java agent, because 
  Java does not like very much to remove and/or modify classes that have already 
  been loaded. We work on that subject, and we hope that this will be possible 
  in a near future....</p>
<h3><a name="adapting"></a>Adapting and extending MadKit </h3>
<h4><a name="console"></a>How could I start MadKit without the Desktop, with only 
  one or two agents? </h4>
<p>Start with console, using the console.bat or console.sh command and define 
  a config.file (a config file is a XML file which contains a set of agents) which 
  will contain the agents you want to launch at startup. See the <a href="userguide/userguide.html#console">Console 
  container in the user guide</a> to get more details and look at the <code>testconfig.cfg</code> 
  file to get the structure of a configuration file (see also the <a href="userguide/userguide.html#configfile">User 
  Guide, configuring the Desktop</a>).</p>
<h4><a name="embedding_madkit"></a>I would like to embed MadKit into my application 
  written in Java</h4>
<p>This is quite easy. If you do not use any of the provided agents (for instance 
  only the communicator and your specific agents) you just have to put <strong>boot.jar</strong> 
  with the jars of your application, and make your classpath application points 
  to these files. You must have some directories (at least <code>libs/madkit</code> 
  and <code>libs/support</code>) to contains all the jars of MadKit that you want 
  to use (<strong>madkit.jar</strong> is required, but you may also use <code>communicator.jar</code> 
  if you want to connect to other kernels, <strong>system.jar</strong> if you 
  plan to use some of the system agents, etc.). You may need also to add some 
  support files (ex: <strong>xerces.jar</strong>) as third party support.</p>
<p>Then, in your applications you must have a line to start and initialize MadKit. 
  In this line you should pass the argument to MadKit and express, that for instance 
  you want to use the agents GUI, and the communicator. In this case, this line 
  should look like:</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><pre class="synopsis">
  <tr>
    <td>
		Vector c = new Vector();
		c.add(&quot;--communicator-on&quot;);
		c.add(&quot;--graphics&quot;);
		c.add(&quot;--config&quot;);
		c.add(&quot;myConfigFile.cfg&quot;);<br>       c.insertElementAt(&quot;madkit.platform.console.Booter&quot;,0);
       madkit.boot.Madkit.main((String[]) c.toArray(new String[0]));<br></td>
  </tr> </pre>
</table>
<p>The console booter is the simplest init program to use for launching MadKit. 
  You may create your own by deriving your boot program from <code>madkit.kernel.AbstractMadkitBooter</code>. 
  You may use a configuration file (here called myConfig.file) to launch agents 
  while starting your application.</p>
<p><strong>Caution</strong>: you do not need to (and should not do it!) add the 
  jar files to your classpath. You only have to make sure that your classpath 
  points to the boot.jar. You may use the config.file to launch agents at start 
  time. </p>
<h4><a name="CPLUSPLUS"></a>Can MadKit use agents written in C or C++</h4>
<p>MadKit may be developped in all languages that are compiled into Java (there 
  are a great number of such languages. See the site {{}} to get a list of all 
  these languages. For the moment, MadKit comes with 4 scripting languages which 
  are executed in the Java Virtual Machine: Scheme (Kawa), Jess (rule based language), 
  BeanShell (Java interpreted) and Python (jython). Using the JNI (Java Native 
  Interface) technique, it should be possible to develop agents written in C or 
  C++. It is also possible to embed Java agents in C/C++ applications using the 
  same technique, using JNI as a glue between the two worlds.</p>
