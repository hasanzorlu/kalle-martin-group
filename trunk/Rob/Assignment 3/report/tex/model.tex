	\item The \\
	
	The robot Denso 6556 has six joints, and all these joint are revolute type. 

1. construct the DH parameters out of the data sheet of the Denso 6556, from six joints, according to these parameters a xml file were created and joint degree limitations were added.
2. The object file was splitted into objects of joints and saved as seperated objects by using AC3D software.
3. In the XML file, frames were placed and the objects of joints were included.
4. The position of objects were changed according to RPY, because each shape were saved and loaded without regards of other shapes.
5. The XML was loaded into RobWork and simulated, small corrections of shapes placement were neccessary.
6. Simple collision ascii .stl models were created and included into the XML file to simulate collision between joints.
