\begin{enumerate}
	\item The \\
	
	The robot Denso 6565 has six joints, and all these joint are revolute type. 

1. Was given DH parameters, from six joints, according these parameters we created the xml file and added joint degree limitations.
2. The object file was splitted into objects of joints and saved as seperated objects by using AC3D software.
3. In the XML file were placed frames and included the objects of joints.
4. The position of objects were changed according RPY, because each shape was saved and loaded without regards of other shapes.
5. The XML was loaded into RobWork and simulated, small corrections of shapes placement were neccessary.
\end{enumerate}
