\section{Introduction}

In this assignment the robot Denso VS-5656 has been analyzed, DH parameters has been found from a datasheet of the Denso and an XML file has been constructed, making it possible to simulate a Denso robot in RobWorkStudio. The specification and a 3D model of the robot has been provided. The 3D model was split into piece dividing the base, joints and end-effector, making it possible to put in onto the simple RobWork skeleton created beforehand.
