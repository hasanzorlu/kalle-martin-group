\section{Conclusion}

The robot was properly simulated with RobWorkStudio. A C\# application was developed to create milling points that are in cartesian coordinates from a user written text. A plugin was developed for RobWorkStudio that create the path from the given points and converts the path to a format that the Fanuc robot can understand. The project group gained practical experience of working with a physical robot, and developing a plugin with RobWorkStudio. 
\\Further improvements to our path planner plugin and LetterFont application were not implemented due to time constraints, but the improvements were discussed in this report.
