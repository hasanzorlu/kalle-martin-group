\section{Testing the System}
\label{sec:test}

The first test of the LetterFont application and the RobWorkStudio plugin were simulated in RobWorkStudio to make sure that robot didn't make any errors. A little movie of that simulated test is put on the cd. The simulation went very well and the path file were uploaded to the robot to tweak some values to make sure that the height is correct so that the milling tool didn't start to far above or under the foam block. This dummy tests are important to do to make sure that the robot doesn't harm itself or its surroundings.

The second and real (milling in the foam) test were done when the other tests had been done successfully. This test is also filmed and put on the cd that is attached to report.
