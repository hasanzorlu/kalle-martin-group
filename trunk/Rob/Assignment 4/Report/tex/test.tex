\section{Testing the System}
\label{sec:test}

The first test of the LetterFont application and the RobWorkStudio plugin were simulated in RobWorkStudio to make sure that robot didn't make any errors. A little movie of that simulated test is put on the cd. The simulation went very well and the path file were uploaded to the robot to tweak some values to make sure that the height is correct so that the milling tool didn't start to far above or under the foam block. This dummy tests are important to do, to make sure that the robot doesn't harm itself or its surroundings.
\\The second test on the actual robot was a success and was recorded and put on the cd but it runs at twice the actual speed of the Fanuc. The speed of the Fanuc was pretty slow due to that we use a constant time frame between points, it doesn't see when multiple point lie in a row. It would be more convinient to calculate a time frame that has constant speed between points independent of the distance between them.
