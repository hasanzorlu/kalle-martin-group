The programs are developed in modules so that i.e. LetterFonts C\# program can be substituted for another program to write letters with.It should just follow the Pathplanner plugins specifications that parse the text file from the LetterFonts program and translates the Cartesian coordinates to joint coordinates. Which can be simulated and uploaded to the Fanuc LR Mate 200i. The simulation in RobWorksStudio is performed before any upload to the robot is commenced to protect it from harm itself or the surroundings. When the robot receives an upload it performs the milling of the letters in the Styrofoam.
