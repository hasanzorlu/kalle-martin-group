\section{Conclusion}


The project goal were to create clothes registering interface and robot arm control by using sorting algorithm. A flexible database and sorting algorithm was created, that collaborates with the other subtasks. The sorting algorithm achieves the set goal, parameters and future improvements have been documented. The goals were achieved by closely collaborating with the groups of subtasks 4 and 6.

Bellow implemented parts:
\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item We introduced and understood the basic principles of MySQL Data base system. ER and UML diagrams were also designed. By using the MySQL language a data base was created and tested.

	\item By using C\# and MySQL .NET connector tool a MySQL library was created which communicates with a MySQL data base. All functionalities of the MySQL library were achieved and tested.

	\item By using C\# a Socket transfer server was created and a communication protocol was also defined. Socket transfer server is used for controlling robot arm.

	\item The main task of the project was to create a sorting algorithm. By using Sorting algorithm all clothes are sorted and information about BinID is stored into
database. Implemented algorithm sorts by color and washing temperature's information of clothes. Later on, is offered and explained more advanced sorting algorithm which could be optimal and improve flexibility.

	\item RFID reader control. By using C\# and .dll libraries was created control logic. Control logic takes care of reliable clothes' reading.
