<p> When building a multi-agent systems, it might be necessary to launch hundred 
  of agents. Until now, that implied in MadKit launching hundred of threads, which 
  is extremely resource-consuming. Thus it was not possible to define artificial-like 
  simulations, hybrid systems, etc with the standard <tt>Agent</tt> class. </p>
<p> In the previous versions we offered a small simulation toolkit, the so-called 
  ReactiveLib, which was a set of classes in the <tt>madkit.lib.reactive</tt> 
  package. In this library, a standard MadKit agent was encapsulating a small 
  simulation engine. There was numerous design flaws with this library: simulated 
  entities were not MadKit agents (thus having no access to the messaging or agent/group/role 
  API), the visualization mechanisms were hard-coded, the agents homogeneous, 
  etc.. </p>
<p> Thus, we wrote from scratch a new engine to permit development of agents that 
  are not associated with a thread, and can be scheduled by an external entity 
  and easily monitored from the outside. </p>

  <p> The synchronous engine provides 5 essential building blocks. The following 
    figure shows an illustration of this architecture:

        <p> In the synchronous engine, any agent can be scheduled or monitored. 
          However, this requires direct reference access to the corresponding 
          agents (as synchronous execution or monitoring is achieved through method 
          invocation or direct variable access). As a main feature of MadKit is 
          that an agent developer never manipulates directly other agents by reference 
          (only with the <tt>AgentAddress</tt>), having direct reference access 
          to any agent would be a major security and stability problem. Thus, 
          we <span class="emphasis"><i>require</i></span> that a developer writing 
          a agent that will be executed in the synchronous engine declares its 
          intention and allows a direct reference. This is made with a empty Java 
          interface, the <a href="../../plugins/madkitkernel/docs/api/madkit/kernel/ReferenceableAgent.html" target="_top"><tt>ReferenceableAgent</tt></a>, 
          which does not require any method implementation: it is just here for 
          typing <span class="emphasis"><i>"yes, I do accept that the class I'm 
          writing can be manipulated through the synchronous engine"</i></span>.

          their input in something meaningful. But in contrast with the scheduler, 
          a watcher is not a threaded agent and have to be executed from the outside, 
          with an associated scheduler. </p>

          have to implement the actual probing mechanism. This mechanism is close

    Minimalist, isn't it ? Things to note in this code is that we inherit from 
    AbstractAgent, and we won't have an associated thread, and the Ant implements 
    (quite easy: there's nothing to do) the <tt>ReferenceableAgent</tt> interface. 
    In contrast with "regular" MadKit agents, we don't have to implements a "<tt>live()</tt> 
    method. We just defined our own <tt>walk()</tt> code.

    <p>We now have to decide how our small ant will be run. To this end, we're

      <p>The activator is the basic bloc of synchronous execution in MadKit. In 
        our example, execution is really simple: we just have to execute the <tt>walk()</tt> 
        method on our ants</p>

   public AntActivator(String group, String role)

      </table>
      Our implementation is really simple. We refine the mandatory <tt>execute()</tt> 
      method to implements our own scheduling mechanism: at each step, we invoke 
      the <tt>walk()</tt> method. The <tt>agents</tt> array is something that 
      the <tt>Activator</tt> class provides us: it holds references to the agents 
      appertaining to the given group and role, <span class="emphasis"><i>only 
      if they implement the <tt>ReferenceableAgent</tt> interface</i></span>. 
      That's something the <tt>MadKit</tt> kernel built for us. Note that we have 
      to cast to <tt>SmallAnt</tt> as the element type is <tt>ReferenceableAgent</tt>. 
      <p></p>
      <p>In this example, we suppose that the number of ants remain constant. 
        If not, we would have to call <tt>update()</tt> on the activator. </p>

    We launched our agent for the simulation in the <tt>activate()</tt> method. 
    Note that although we used the <tt>launchAgent(...)</tt>, the kernel will 
    not actually "run" the agents by itself as they need to be scheduled. Also, 
    we precised in this call that we don't want MadKit to try to instantiate a 
    hypothetical graphical interface for each of these agents (but that's possible 
    anyway, especially if we want something to control the behavior of these agents). 
    <p></p>
    <p>The <tt>live()</tt> method is the real thing: we build an instance of our 
      tool class <tt>AntActivator</tt> and add it to the collection of activators 
      managed by our scheduler. Note that the activators are configured with the 
      group/role mechanism. Then, we call the scheduler <tt>update()</tt> method 
      which makes the activator gets their agent list according to their configured 
      group and role.</p>
    <p> The final part is executing our ants again and again. That's the final 
      <tt>while</tt> loop were we execute the activator. </p>

    <p> Our example is now complete and runs well, but there is a small inconvenience: 
      we can't see anything ! </p>
    <p>To solve this problem, we could have added some instruction in the ant 
      to trace its behavior, or access it from the scheduler. However, that is 
      not really extensible and hard-coding an observation mechanism could be 
      annoying (what if we want a graphical representation ? and then dump everything 
      in a DBMS ? and then .. ? and everything at the same time ? etc, etc)</p>
    <p>The synchronous engine in MadKit introduces a way to observe the system 
      from the outside. It is very similar to the scheduler/activator mechanism.

        quite easy to do, but just use a generic probe that ship with MadKit in

    <p>This simplistic example does not really show the genericity of the Synchronous 
      Engine. Things are getting really interesting when you have multiple observers 
      show differing point of views on a system, or different groups being scheduled 
      independently, with many agents executed according to their roles, etc.. 
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="../../plugins/demos/docs/beeworld.html">bees example</a> in the 
      demo source code shows something more elaborated, while being close to the 
      ant example. For something more complex, see the <a href="../../plugins/turtlekit/docs/turtlekit.html" target="_top">"TurtleKit"</a> 
      (a StarLogo-like) simulation packs and the corresponding examples.</p>
    <p> A final word: the synchronous engine is definitively not restricted to 
      simulations: actually, most of the "classic" agents could be scheduled in 
      synchronous mode by just inheriting from <tt>AbstractAgent</tt> instead 
      of <tt>Agent</tt> and having an activator configured on their <tt>live()</tt> 
      method.</p>
